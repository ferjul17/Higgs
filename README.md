Higgs, the new vision of the forums
=====

Hi everyone,

First of all, I ask for forgiveness for my english. I'm not used to speack english.

I decided to aggregate some new web technologies to design a new forum engine.

I use silex, propel (i'm waiting for the version 2.0), twig, monolog, angularjs, jquery...
